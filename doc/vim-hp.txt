1. Usage                                                            *hp-usage*

The main feature of this plugin is generating a contents of your
documentation. The command |HpGenerateContents| generates a contents of the
current buffer and put it under cursor. By default, width of the contents will
be equal to the |textwidth|, but you can specified it explicitly: >
  :HpGenerateContents 30
<

To update the contents after some file changes the |HpRefresh| exists. This
command updates sections and regenerates the contents. It can be invoked in
any place of the document.

Note: all commands are available only for 'help' files.

See more details in the section |hp-commands|.

1.1. Sections                                                    *hp-sections*

Every section in the documentation are considered as a part of the text from a
title of one section to a title of the next section. The title of a section
consists of the following parts: [{index}]{name}{tag}. 

The {index} is an optional part of the title. It should contain numbers or
number signs (`#`) separated by the dot symbol. The last dot is optional.  For
example: `1.` or `1.1` or `#.#` and so on. Also, you can mix numbers and
number signes: `1.#`. 

The {tag} is a sequence of symbols between the `*` as it customary in Vim help.

The {name} is a trimmed sequence of symbols between index (or beginning of the
line) and tag.

2. Commands                                                      *hp-commands*

The following commands are provided by vim-hp for buffers with |filetype| `help`:
  * |HpGenerateContents| 
  * |HpRefresh|
  * |LeftRight|

                                                          *HpGenerateContents*
:HpGenerateContents [{width}]   Generates a contents of the current buffer and
                                put it under cursor. If {width} is specified
                                then contents will take only {width} columns.
                                If {width} is absent then |textwidth| will be
                                used, or 80 when |textwidth| is 0.

                                                                   *HpRefresh*
:HpRefresh                      Updates a sequential numbers of sections 
                                according to their actual order. Then
                                regenerates a contents. If the contents is not
                                found, this command will throw an exception
                                with advice to generate a contents.

                                                                   *LeftRight*
:LeftRight                      Moves a text before cursor to the left part of
                                the document and other text to the right part
                                according to the |textwidth|. 
                                Example: >
                                  some line of the text
                                            ^
                                     cursor is here
                                  
                                  :LeftRight
                                  
                                  some line                       of the text
